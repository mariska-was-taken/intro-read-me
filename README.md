# intro-read-me
hello! my name is Mortimer, i go by He/Him. i'm usually active (almost everyday) for about 2 hours because i have school... i am a minor
my interests are: Deltarune/Undertale, Forsaken, Touhou and South Park
i'm in a lot of other fandoms (ask!) but those are my special interests right now :D
tags i use a lot: w2i = whisper to interact, DNI = do not interact with me AT ALL, afk = off tab, away from keyboard

important: i really only play ponytown when i'm bored and want to talk to people! if you are around my age i don't mind talking to you on discord or something similar, but please ask - i am not good with interacting outside of the game!!

this will get updated soon but yeah c:
